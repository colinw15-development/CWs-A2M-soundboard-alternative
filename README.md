# CWs-A2M-soundboard-alternative
This is my first App project, with this, you can quickly setup a type of "soundboard" that let's you directly
upload files and BLAST them through your microphone by using BlackHole 2ch (macOS) or VB-Cable (Windows)
It's extremely easy to use and you'll find out how easy it is when you look at the interface. 

Enjoy and please report any bugs!
